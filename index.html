    <p>Prison Break is an old fashioned text adventure game where you are trying to escape your prison cell
        that was left unlocked by the night guard Henry.

    <p>The way you play is that you travel from room to room by clicking the options provided to you. Just be careful
        where you tread...  You just might end up getting caught by Henry, or even worse, your DOOM!
    </p>
