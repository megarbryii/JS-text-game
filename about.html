    <div class='about-company'>
        <p>Here at Sinners and Saints Studios we strive to bring you the best in video game entertainment, whether
            they are 2D platformers to 3D shooters to retro games like text adventures.
        </p>

        <p>That is why we aim to make the best quality games that we can, all while implementing the best 
            quality controls to provide the best product for your entertainment.  We would rather have a game
             come out late and provide a better product rather than push out a game full of glitches and bugs 
             just so we can earn a few more dollars.  We take pride in our prodcuts and our work, and we want our 
             employees to feel that same pride.
        </p>

        <p>If you ever have any questions about our products, please do not hesitate to email us
            <a href='mailto:megarbry@gmail.com'>here</a>.
